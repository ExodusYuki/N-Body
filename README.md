# Parallel N-Body Simulator

Simulations of dynamical systems of particles are often used in physics to predict behavior of planets, stars, galaxies, gas particles... The interaction between particles is described by physically sound equations and ”integrated” in time to predict the outcome of the simulation.

### Features
- Uses the *Barnes-Hut* algorithm and the *Naive N-Body* algorithm to simulate particle gravity interactions in C++ 11
- Parallelization using *Intel Thread Building Blocks*

### Documentation
